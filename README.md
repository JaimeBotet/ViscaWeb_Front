# ViscaWeb Front End Technical Test

In this application I made an approach for the task that was asked. I used a template taken from the internet and modified it to meet the requirements.
I used Bootstrap imported with NPM.

## Features

1. Responsive Web-Mobile
2. Animated Cards
3. MouseOver animated menu linkss
4. Different links

## To get Started

First you need to install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

So that the folder _node_modules_ gets installed locally with the libraries of _bootstrap_ and _jquery_.
